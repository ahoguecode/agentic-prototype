 # Prevent Duplicate Dev Server Commands

This rule prevents running `npm run dev` commands in terminal instances since we assume it's already running in another terminal.

      The dev server is assumed to be already running in another terminal.
      
      Instead of starting a new dev server:
      1. Use the existing dev server instance
      2. If the dev server is not running, check your other terminal windows
      3. Only start a new dev server if you've confirmed no other instance is running

examples:
  - input: "npm run dev"
    output: "Command rejected - dev server already running"
